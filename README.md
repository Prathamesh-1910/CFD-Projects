**Lid Driven Cavity**

The lid-driven cavity problem is a classic benchmark in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) that involves the simulation of fluid flow inside a square or rectangular cavity with one side (the "lid") moving tangentially while the other sides remain stationary. This movement creates a complex flow pattern with vortices and boundary layers, making it an ideal test case for evaluating the accuracy and stability of numerical methods and solvers. The problem is used to study various flow regimes, ranging from laminar to turbulent, depending on the Reynolds number, and serves as a foundational problem in fluid dynamics. 

**Couette flow**

The Couette flow problem describes the steady, laminar flow of a viscous fluid between two parallel plates, where one plate is stationary, and the other moves at a constant velocity. This creates a simple shear flow with a linear velocity profile. The problem is often used to study shear-driven flows and evaluate fluid properties such as viscosity, and it serves as a fundamental case in fluid dynamics for validating numerical methods and understanding boundary layer behavior. Couette flow can also be extended to include effects like pressure gradients, non-Newtonian fluids, and heat transfer. horizontal velocity was plotted at various height and time levelsfrom initial state to steady state.

**Sudden contraction flow**

Sudden contraction flow refers to the fluid flow through a channel or pipe that experiences a sudden decrease in cross-sectional area. As the fluid passes through the contraction, it accelerates, leading to complex flow phenomena such as boundary layer separation, vortex formation, and potential flow recirculation zones downstream of the contraction. The sudden change in geometry causes a sharp increase in fluid velocity, often accompanied by a corresponding drop in pressure, which can lead to turbulent flow depending on the Reynolds number. Streamlines, vortex and horizontal velocity at various horizontal spots was discussed.
